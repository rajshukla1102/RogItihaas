<ul>
<li>In the current scenerio in India,we are rapidly growing on the pathway of transforming each and every sector with the help of technology.Our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has also been enthusiastically supporting the growth of technology in various sectors.</li>
<li>But still there always remains a scope wherein we could introduce technology and ease the entire procedure and develop something that could make our lives easier.</li>
<li>Our team figured out such a gap in the heathcare sector wherein we believed that people faced a lot of difficulties in - 
<ul>
<li>Managing and maintaing all the recent medical records.</li>
<li>There was a lot of paper wastage in the medical industry as we are still reliant on hardcopy prescription.</li>
<li>We have the system of online consultation in place and also we have the online medicine delivery in place, but we do not have a single platform to manage both.</li>
</ul>
<li>In emergency cases it will not be a practical situtation to search for all the medical records and present them which adds on to the challanges.</li>
<li>It is also a major difficulty for the people living in villages to travel long distances and get medical help.Thus we also aim to add in an added feature known as diagnosis and prescription to diagnose the disease and prescribe an online prescription.</li>
<li>To top it all we have integrated AI/ML to diagnose the disease on the basis of the symptoms.</li>
<li>In the present situation, the doctor has to take the concern of family before any critical surgery and this process takes time as it might be that the patient's family might not be able to travel to the hospital immediately.</li>

Project Architecture
</h3> 
<hr>
<p>Our entire project is divided into 4 parts-</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Doctor Section</strong>-First of all as a doctor you have to sign up with all your details if you are not a member.If you have already registered then login to the application directly.After login you will see a Doctor dashboard with some basic details.Here you have a section to create a sample prescription by uploading your clinic logo,name,etc. details<br>
A doctor can also be a patient thus we have also added sections of medical records and a section to view their personalized health card.<br>
The doctor section also has a search bar at the top to search for patients they want to access.</li>
<li><strong>Patient Section</strong>-The patient will have to first sign up with all the details.If already registered the patient can directly login to use the application.After logging in the patient can see a patient dashboard with all the sections and muliple sections similar to doctor like medical records and a personalized soft copy of health card.<br>
In the document section we have provided option to download all the medical documents all at once and individually also.<br>
Two additional sections in the patient is the diagnosis section, wherein patients can diagnose a disease with the help of an AI/ML integrated system with symptom based disease prediction.Another section is the online medicine section which alerts the nearest pharmacy an online request to deliver medicines.</li>
<li><strong>Patient-Doctor interaction</strong>-This is sort of a hidden section which can only be viewed once a doctor enters and accesses the patient section.This section is similar to the patient section but has read-only capabilities so that the patient data remains secure and intact.The doctor can view past medical history,get an overview of patient's health condition and in succession write an online prescription to the patient in our online prescription system which will be automatically uploaded to medical records of patient on successful submission.The patient can download and view the prescription from here else he/she will also spontenously get an email with the prescription attached.</li>
<li><strong>Pharmacy Section</strong>-To access the pharmacy section the pharmacy needs to sign up and fill the details to create an account.Once done, the pharmacy can directly login to the system and can track the medicines in their shop, online delivery tracking, can generate a bill online and accept or reject patient's request for medicine.</li>
</ol>

<h3 align="center">Unique Features</h3>
<hr>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>-The UI is built with an aim to make it so easy to understand that anyone from a small child to an elder person could easily navigate and figure out how to use the application.In case someone is facing problems and unable to figure his/her way out, we have also added a video demonstration to give a walkthrough of our application</li>
<li><strong>Patient and doctor-centric approach</strong>-Mostly the healthcard pltforms are more dctor centric than patient centric, but our platform focuses on providing unique features benefiting both the parties.</li>
<li><strong>Data Security</strong>-The entire database is encrypted via our python security code and data security is one of the most unique faetures of our application.Encryption is not the only thing we focus on.We have added email alerts for each login session into a doctor or patient account.In addition we have also leveraged the power procided by the combination of AMD and Google cloud and used the Convidential VM on the C2D system which will keep the data encrypted on the fly during data transfer and handling</li>
<li><strong>QR code</strong>-We rely on a QR code system rather than a unique card number.This will procide ease of use to the patients as well as the doctor by providing instant access to the health account.</li>
<li><strong>100% Paperless</strong>-We have kept all the document in a soft copy format from health card to medical prescription.The soft copy will not only save paper but will also help to keep our medical records safer with no worry of documents getting lost.We have also provided a facility to send prescription on mobile.The soft copy will save approximately 25 lakh trees.</li>
<li><strong>The Doctor and Pharmacy gap bridging</strong>-We have tried to bridge the gap between the doctor and pharmacist, two important pillars of our health system and centralized the entire process keeping in mind that if a patient is unable to come to the clinic he/she is also not able to go to the pharmacy store and thus centralizing the system will help transform and help many people.In addition, we will also be able to stardadize the prescription type for the pharmacist to reduce the complexity at their end.</li>

<h3 align="center">Future Scope</h3>
<hr>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mobile Number based authentication</strong>-Currently we rely on the email based OTP authentication but in future we aim to add in mobile number based authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Improve security</strong>-Security is a feature of topmost priority for any medical system as medical records are a very sensitive user data.</li>
<li><strong>Make a profitable app for doctors</strong>-In future we aim to add some extra benefits to the doctors which could make them come to our application daily.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits for poor people</strong>-We aim to add in benefits for the poor by linking our application to online donation agencies which will be very beneficial to procide free healthcare facilities for the poor.</li>
<li><strong>A centralized application for all medical needs</strong>-Our final destination is to add value to humanity with centralizing all medical needs for the people not diverting from our original goal.We want to contribute to the easy availability of doctors,medical equipments,blood and organ donors,oxygen cylinder,etc. This will ensure that we are not underprepared in case a global pandemic such as COVID-19 hits us again.</li>
<li><strong>We aim to centralize the finances of the pharmacy and doctors so that we could track their income and prevent malpractice.</li>
<li><strong>We also want to integrate an online billing system for pharmasist to make their job easier.</li>
